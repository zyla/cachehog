# CacheHog - IPC via cache timing

NOTE: This is the most naive implementation of this idea. For stuff that _really_ works (and has a nice paper about it), see [Cache Based Jamming Agreement](https://github.com/IAIK/CJAG).

Randomly accessing a big chunk memory causes a lot of main memory accesses due
to limited size of CPU caches. When two processes to that at the same time, a
noticeable slowdown can be observed.

This creates an interesting information channel. The transmission procedure is
as follows: Divide time into intervals (5 milliseconds, for example). If
transmitting a `1`, randomly access a chunk of memory ("hog the cache") during
the whole interval.  If transmitting a `0`, do nothing during the whole
interval.

To receive data, hog the cache and measure how fast it's happening (how many
operations per interval). Intuitively, "fast" means `0`, and "slow" means `1`
(because another process is transmitting).

There are several challenges:

1. The channel is very noisy (obviously - another processes are also running on
   the same system). To diminish noise effects, oversampling is used. One
   logical bit is transmitted over several intervals.

2. It's difficult to know when another process starts transmitting.

    Currently before transmission of a word (8 bits), a `SYNC` word is transmitted
    (`10101010`). On the receiving side it's detected using Hamming distance and
    used to align to bit boundaries of the sender.

3. We don't precisely know what is "slow" and "fast".

    The receiver measures operations per second for the duration of a whole word
    and then performs _thresholding_ - assigning the binary value `0` to a
    measurement if it's above average, and `1` if it's below average.

    TODO: This has significant drawbacks. For example, it's very difficult to
    recognize the words `00000000` and `11111111`.

## Running it

Compile with `make`.

The receiver reads from standard input, and the transmitter writes to standard
output. In one terminal run

    ./cachehog receive

Then in another:

    ./cachehog transmit

and type some text. It should appear (most probably garbled) at the receiving
side.

For example, transmitting this file could result in something like this
(hexdumped and interleaved with the original):

```

Not bad.

Note: Tested on my machine (i7-4710HQ), probably won't work well or at all on
others. If you experience issues, try randomly tweaking some parameters.

## Testbench

Compile with `make testbench`.

Run as:

    ./testbench [message]

If you don't specify a message, default one will be used.

Possible output:

    $ ./testbench
    Message size: 28
    Estimated running time: 22 sec
    Received 28 bytes (224 bits)
    Lost 0 bytes
    ORG: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.
    REC: Lorm ipsum dolorsit amet.
    Total error bits: 10, bit error rate: 0.044643

NOTE: testbench does not run any diffing algorithm so if any of byte is lost in
transmission, error bit count will be higher than you might expect.

NOTE2: unlike `./cachehog` testbench uses POSIX functions so will probably not
work on Windows (not tested!).

## Signal visualization

Sometimes it's useful to see the "signal" received by cachehog. To do that:

1. Run some transmission in the background.

2. Run record mode:

```
./cachehog record 320 > /tmp/samples.txt
```

The number provided is the number of samples to measure.
Raw sample values are output to stdout.

3. `visualize.py` can be used to view the result.

_(requires matplotlib)_

```
./visualize.py < /tmp/samples.txt
```

## Debugging

There are some `printf`s hidden behind the `DEBUG` flag. Look at the source.

## Ideas (feel free to implement)

- Add forward error correction (Hamming codes, or something else)
- Add acknowledgements and automatic retransmission on failure
- Use some fancy information theory to get better BER or transmission rate
- Collision detection and multiplexing
- Port to JavaScript and deanonymize unsuspecting Tor users
- Profit
